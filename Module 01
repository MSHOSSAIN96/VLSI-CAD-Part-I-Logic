Recognize how a "CAD flow" of tools gradually refines designs from abstract to concrete representations; synthesis tools add detail, and verification tools ensure that synthesis procedures are valid.

**Definitions and Terminology:**
ASIC: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, designed for specific tasks, often using semi-custom design approaches.

EDA vs. CAD: CAD generally refers to design software, while EDA is a specialized term for electronic design automation.

System-on-a-Chip (SoC): Refers to integrating multiple functional blocks (e.g., CPU, memory) onto a single chip.


**Key Concepts:**
CAD Flow: The sequence of steps in designing ICs, including synthesis (creation of design elements) and verification (ensuring correctness).

Tools and Algorithms: The course aims to explain critical algorithms, data structures, and modeling assumptions used in CAD flow.

This introductory part sets the stage for learning about the design tools and methodologies used in VLSI, particularly for students interested in the technical aspects of chip design and automation.

Part 1 introduces Boolean algebra for computational purposes, logic verification, and two-level and multi-level logic synthesis. 

Focusing on CAD for semi-custom ASICs, begins with an introduction to key mathematical concepts such as discrete math, basic calculus, and matrix fundamentals. Exposure to chip layout and VLSI is beneficial but not essential, as essential knowledge will be provided.

On a technical level, the course addresses CAD (computer-aided design) for ASICsâ€”Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, which are custom-designed chips for specific functions. In a semi-custom design approach, previously designed parts are reused, reducing design complexity and costs as opposed to full-custom, transistor-level designs.

The course centers on the logic synthesis to layout synthesis process. Starting from high-level descriptions (e.g., Verilog or VHDL), logic synthesis translates these into gates and wires, which drive layout synthesis, determining gate and wire placement on the chip. Libraries of pre-designed parts support the design process.

Another focus is the CAD or EDA (Electronic Design Automation) flow, which progresses from abstract designs to concrete implementations through two primary steps: synthesis and verification. Synthesis steps add detail, moving the design toward completion, while verification steps check for accuracy at each stage.

The course is divided into two parts: Part 1: Logic and 

Part 2: Layout. Part 1 covers four major logic topics:

Computational Boolean Algebra: Understanding Boolean equations as manipulable data structures for automated processing.

Boolean Verification: Methods like BDDs (Binary Decision Diagrams) and SAT (Satisfiability) for confirming logic network equivalency.

Two-Level Logic Synthesis: Synthesis for simple AND/OR logical structures.

Multi-Level Logic Synthesis: Synthesis for more complex, industrial-strength logic designs.
