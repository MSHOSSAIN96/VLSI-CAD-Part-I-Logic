# VLSI-CAD-Part-I-Logic
Recognize how a "CAD flow" of tools gradually refines designs from abstract to concrete representations; synthesis tools add detail, and verification tools ensure that synthesis procedures are valid.  
**Module 01: **
**Welcome and Introduction**

**Definitions and Terminology:**
ASIC: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, designed for specific tasks, often using semi-custom design approaches.

EDA vs. CAD: CAD generally refers to design software, while EDA is a specialized term for electronic design automation.

System-on-a-Chip (SoC): Refers to integrating multiple functional blocks (e.g., CPU, memory) onto a single chip.

**Key Concepts:**
CAD Flow: The sequence of steps in designing ICs, including synthesis (creation of design elements) and verification (ensuring correctness).

Tools and Algorithms: The course aims to explain critical algorithms, data structures, and modeling assumptions used in CAD flow.

This introductory part sets the stage for learning about the design tools and methodologies used in VLSI, particularly for students interested in the technical aspects of chip design and automation.
