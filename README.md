Key Phrases/Concepts 
Keep your eyes open for the following key terms or phrases as you interact with the lecture videos and complete the activities.

Here are brief explanations of each term:

Shannon Cofactors:

Shannon cofactors are derived from Shannon’s expansion theorem, which decomposes a Boolean function based on a particular variable. The positive cofactor is obtained by setting the variable to 1, and the negative cofactor is obtained by setting it to 0. This technique simplifies complex Boolean functions by analyzing them in terms of specific variables.

Boolean Difference:

The Boolean difference of a function with respect to a variable represents the sensitivity of the function to changes in that variable. It is calculated by taking the exclusive OR (XOR) of the function’s positive and negative cofactors. Boolean difference is used in fault detection and sensitivity analysis in digital circuits.
Universal and Existential Quantification:

Universal Quantification: Refers to whether a Boolean function is true for all values of a given variable. This is often used to test whether a property holds universally across all configurations.
Existential Quantification: Refers to whether there exists at least one value of a given variable that makes the Boolean function true. This is used to verify if there is at least one configuration that satisfies a particular property.

PCN and URP:

PCN (Primary Canonical Normal Form): This is a standard way of representing Boolean functions using basic logical operators in a consistent, canonical structure. It simplifies comparisons and manipulations of Boolean expressions.

URP (Unate Recursive Paradigm): A representation or method that simplifies Boolean functions by leveraging "unate" properties (functions that are either monotonic increasing or decreasing with respect to each variable). 
URP is useful in optimization, as unate functions are generally simpler to manipulate.
These terms are foundational for understanding Boolean logic and optimization techniques in digital circuit design, especially in contexts like VLSI CAD.
