**Definitions and Terminology:**
ASIC: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, designed for specific tasks, often using semi-custom design approaches.

EDA vs. CAD: CAD generally refers to design software, while EDA is a specialized term for electronic design automation.

System-on-a-Chip (SoC): Refers to integrating multiple functional blocks (e.g., CPU, memory) onto a single chip.


**Key Concepts:**
CAD Flow: The sequence of steps in designing ICs, including synthesis (creation of design elements) and verification (ensuring correctness).

Tools and Algorithms: The course aims to explain critical algorithms, data structures, and modeling assumptions used in CAD flow.

This introductory part sets the stage for learning about the design tools and methodologies used in VLSI, particularly for students interested in the technical aspects of chip design and automation.

Part 1 introduces Boolean algebra for computational purposes, logic verification, and two-level and multi-level logic synthesis. 

Focusing on CAD for semi-custom ASICs, begins with an introduction to key mathematical concepts such as discrete math, basic calculus, and matrix fundamentals. Exposure to chip layout and VLSI is beneficial but not essential, as essential knowledge will be provided.

On a technical level, the course addresses CAD (computer-aided design) for ASICs—Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, which are custom-designed chips for specific functions. In a semi-custom design approach, previously designed parts are reused, reducing design complexity and costs as opposed to full-custom, transistor-level designs.

The course centers on the logic synthesis to layout synthesis process. Starting from high-level descriptions (e.g., Verilog or VHDL), logic synthesis translates these into gates and wires, which drive layout synthesis, determining gate and wire placement on the chip. Libraries of pre-designed parts support the design process.

Another focus is the CAD or EDA (Electronic Design Automation) flow, which progresses from abstract designs to concrete implementations through two primary steps: synthesis and verification. Synthesis steps add detail, moving the design toward completion, while verification steps check for accuracy at each stage.

The course is divided into two parts: Part 1: Logic and 

Part 2: Layout. Part 1 covers four major logic topics:

Computational Boolean Algebra: Understanding Boolean equations as manipulable data structures for automated processing.

Boolean Verification: Methods like BDDs (Binary Decision Diagrams) and SAT (Satisfiability) for confirming logic network equivalency.

Two-Level Logic Synthesis: Synthesis for simple AND/OR logical structures.

Multi-Level Logic Synthesis: Synthesis for more complex, industrial-strength logic designs.

In the above diagram provides an overview of a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) layout, illustrating the integration of various functional blocks on a single chip. The key components are labeled as follows:

CPU Core: This block represents the central processing unit, which performs the primary computational tasks on the chip. It’s often a pre-designed block integrated into the SoC.

Random Logic: This area contains various logic circuits, which are usually unique to specific functions within the chip. These circuits are not standardized like other elements, hence the term "random."

Memory: This block typically includes SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) or other types of memory modules, used for storing data or instructions temporarily during operation.

Datapath (Arithmetic): This section handles arithmetic operations, often involving circuits like adders and multipliers. It is responsible for executing mathematical and logical operations needed by the CPU or other parts of the chip.

Standard Cells: The description mentions "row-based standard cells," which are basic building blocks for digital circuits, organized in rows. They usually contain gates and flip-flops used to implement the chip's logic.

Wiring: This connects different blocks and cells within the SoC, allowing communication between them.

Overall, the diagram illustrates how an SoC is designed to integrate various components—CPU, memory, logic, and arithmetic units—into a single chip, with each section handling a specific function to support efficient, cohesive operation. This integration allows the SoC to execute a wide range of tasks within a compact space.

Course description:

This course is an introduction to designing complex VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) chips, which contain numerous components such as logic units, control circuits, memory blocks, and interconnections. Modern chips may have billions of transistors and millions of logic gates, organized to perform both computation and control functions. Additionally, they often incorporate large memory blocks and third-party modules, called IP (Intellectual Property) blocks, which are pre-designed functional units like processors or specialized circuits.

Designing these intricate chips manually is impractical, so engineers rely on a series of CAD (Computer-Aided Design) tools. These tools allow designers to start with an abstract, high-level description of a chip and gradually refine it through multiple steps until it reaches a detailed, concrete final design. This course will explore the major CAD tools and techniques used specifically for creating ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) and SoCs (Systems on Chips).

In this first part of the course, we focus on essential methods for representing and manipulating Boolean logic, which is critical for the initial stages of chip design. Boolean logic, the foundation of digital circuits, is the basis for translating high-level descriptions into actual gate-level circuits. The course emphasizes understanding how the CAD tools operate at a foundational level, covering key algorithms and data structures that make these tools functional.

Key Topics in Part 1:
Computational Boolean Algebra: This topic covers methods for representing and working with Boolean equations as computational entities, enabling automatic manipulation of complex logic expressions.
Logic Verification: This involves using techniques like Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and Satisfiability (SAT) methods to check whether different logic circuits produce equivalent results, ensuring accuracy in the design.
Logic Synthesis:
Two-Level Logic Synthesis: Simplified methods for designing basic AND/OR logical structures.
Multi-Level Logic Synthesis: More advanced synthesis techniques for creating complex, layered logic circuits required in industrial designs.
Overall, this course provides a deep dive into the algorithms and structures behind the CAD tools that enable engineers to design the complex logic at the core of modern digital systems.

[kbdd-tutorial.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17691883/kbdd-tutorial.pdf)

This document is a tutorial on using the kbdd software package, a BDD (Binary Decision Diagram) calculator, developed by Professor Randy Bryant’s group at Carnegie Mellon University. The tutorial is provided as part of the "VLSI CAD: Logic to Layout" course at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and serves as a hands-on guide for students to understand and apply Boolean function manipulation using BDDs.

Key Highlights of the Tutorial
Introduction to kbdd:

kbdd offers a command-line interface to work with Boolean functions for VLSI CAD applications, particularly in logic verification and synthesis.
It provides operators and commands to declare variables, evaluate Boolean expressions, and perform complex manipulations, making it suitable for tasks that would be difficult to handle manually.

Basic Commands:

Commands such as boolean to declare variables, eval to evaluate expressions, bdd to print BDD representations, and satisfy to find satisfying variable assignments are highlighted.
The tutorial includes examples for each command and provides explanations for commands like adder for creating n-bit adders and mux for multiplexers.

Example - Adder Circuit Repair:

A practical example demonstrates how kbdd can be used to fix a one-bit adder circuit with an error (a NOR gate used instead of an OR gate). The process involves creating a correct BDD, defining an incorrect version, and using a MUX to mimic the correct function by quantifying and satisfying specific variables.
BDDs and Negation Arcs:

kbdd uses a concept called "negation arcs," where an edge leaving a BDD node represents an inverted function, which optimizes node usage by about half.
The document explains how to interpret kbdd's output, including variable names, node memory addresses, and inversion bubbles (denoted by !).

Advanced Usage and Syntax:

The document covers syntax nuances, such as handling n-bit adders, interpreting printed BDDs, and using range notations for variable declarations.
An example of a straightforward BDD structure without negation arcs is also shown to help users understand variations in BDD representations.
In summary, the document provides a structured approach to using kbdd for manipulating Boolean functions, offering insights into both basic operations and more complex repairs and optimizations in logic networks. It also provides troubleshooting tips and usage notes, making it a valuable resource for students in VLSI CAD.

[minisat-tutorial.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17691930/minisat-tutorial.pdf)

This document is a tutorial on using MiniSat, a SAT (Satisfiability) solver developed by Niklas Eén and Niklas Sörensson. The MiniSat tool is an essential part of VLSI CAD for verifying the correctness of digital logic designs. The tutorial is designed to help students use MiniSat to solve Boolean satisfiability problems, especially in the context of logic circuit verification.

Key Highlights of the Tutorial
Introduction to MiniSat:

MiniSat is a compact and efficient SAT solver, commonly used for VLSI CAD and various other fields. It checks if there exists an assignment of variables that satisfies a Boolean formula expressed in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).
The document highlights that MiniSat uses a common input format called DIMACS, which is a standard for expressing SAT problems.
DIMACS Format:

The DIMACS format starts with comments (lines beginning with "c") and a problem line (starting with "p cnf") specifying the number of variables and clauses.
Each clause is a line of integers: positive numbers represent uncomplemented variables (e.g., 2 for $x_2$ ), and negative numbers represent complemented variables (e.g., -3 for - $x_3$ ). Each clause line ends with a 0.

Example - Simple SAT Problem:

The tutorial provides an example of a small CNF problem to demonstrate how to format it for MiniSat and interpret the results.
For instance, the CNF formula ($x_1$ + - $x_3$) ($x_2$ +$x_3$ + - $x_1$) is converted into DIMACS format and input to MiniSat. MiniSat outputs both problem statistics and a SAT or UNSAT answer, including a satisfying assignment if it exists.

Advanced Example - Circuit Comparison:

A more complex example shows how MiniSat can check the equivalence of two logic networks by connecting their outputs with an XOR gate. If the XOR output can be set to 1, the circuits are not equivalent.
The example converts the circuit to CNF format and uses MiniSat to check satisfiability. If MiniSat finds a satisfying assignment, it means there exists an input that produces different outputs for the two circuits.

Understanding MiniSat Output:
MiniSat outputs statistics about the internal SAT-solving process, such as the number of conflicts, decisions, and propagations it encountered during the search.
The result section provides the SAT/UNSAT outcome and a variable assignment (e.g., -1 2 -3 0), where positive numbers indicate true values and negative numbers indicate false values in the satisfying assignment.

Handling NaN in MiniSat Output:
Occasionally, MiniSat may output "nan" (Not-a-Number) in statistics. This typically happens due to division by zero, for instance, when there are zero conflict literals, or when system time measurements are too small to register accurately.

Summary
The MiniSat tutorial introduces students to setting up and solving SAT problems using DIMACS format, interpreting MiniSat’s output, and understanding how it can be applied in VLSI CAD to verify circuit logic and detect non-equivalence in logic designs. This hands-on guide supports the use of MiniSat in practical scenarios within digital circuit verification and logic synthesis.


[espresso-tutorial.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17691983/espresso-tutorial.pdf)

This document is a tutorial on using ESPRESSO, a logic minimization tool for optimizing two-level Boolean logic expressions. Developed at the University of California, Berkeley, ESPRESSO is widely used in VLSI CAD for optimizing logic circuits by reducing the number of terms and literals, thus simplifying circuit design and improving efficiency.

Key Highlights of the Tutorial
Introduction to ESPRESSO:

ESPRESSO is a tool for optimizing two-level (AND-OR) logic expressions. It uses a heuristic called "reduce-expand-irredundant" to minimize the logic, a method that has influenced many modern logic synthesis tools.
This tutorial focuses on running ESPRESSO in its standard mode to simplify Boolean functions without needing to explore advanced options.
Input File Format:

ESPRESSO accepts input files in a specific format:
.i [d]: Specifies the number of input variables.

.o [d]: Specifies the number of output functions.

.ilb and .ob: Used to label inputs and outputs.

Each line in the file represents a term in the truth table, where - indicates a “don’t care” input, 0 indicates a complemented variable, and 1 indicates an uncomplemented variable.

Optimization Example:

The document provides an example of a simple logic function with four inputs and one output:

```
.i 4
.o 1
.ilb w x y z
.ob f
0-11   1
01-1   1
1011   1
1111   -
```
In this example, running ESPRESSO produces an optimized output with fewer terms. For instance:

```
--11   1
01-1   1
```
This indicates the minimized expression 
𝑓=𝑦𝑧+𝑤′𝑥𝑧, reducing the circuit complexity.

Logic Minimization Techniques:

The document discusses ESPRESSO's ability to work with ON-sets, OFF-sets, and DC-sets:

ON-set: Terms where the function outputs 1.

OFF-set: Terms where the function outputs 0.

DC-set (Don’t Care): Terms where the function’s output does not affect the circuit's behavior.

Various .type keywords (f, fd, fr, fdr) allow users to specify how ESPRESSO should handle these sets, optimizing the function by possibly including don’t-care terms to reduce overall complexity.

Symbols in ESPRESSO:

Symbols used in the input matrix:

1 denotes an active variable in a product term.

0 denotes a complemented variable.

- indicates the variable does not appear in the term.
  
Multiple-valued logic is also supported, allowing variables to have more than two states.

Advanced Usage and Examples:

The document provides examples with varying complexities, including:

Two-bit adder: Defines a truth table for adding two 2-bit numbers.

Multiple-valued functions: Demonstrates optimization of functions with multi-state variables.

KISS-style encoding: Encodes finite state machines (FSMs) with symbolic states, useful for state encoding in digital design.

Applications:

ESPRESSO is suitable for simplifying large Boolean functions with multiple variables, outputs, and states, making it highly applicable in designing simplified and cost-effective logic circuits in digital hardware.

Summary

This tutorial offers an in-depth guide on using ESPRESSO for Boolean logic minimization, providing examples, syntax, and options for optimizing both simple and complex logic functions in digital circuit design.

[sis-tutorial.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17692050/sis-tutorial.pdf)

This document is a tutorial on using the SIS (Sequential Interactive Synthesis) software package, a tool for multi-level logic optimization in VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration) CAD (Computer-Aided Design). SIS, developed at the University of California, Berkeley, is an advanced tool for optimizing Boolean networks—models of logic circuits used in VLSI design.

Key Components of the Document:
Introduction to SIS:

SIS is an extended version of the earlier MIS tool and is designed to help optimize multi-level logic. It automates Boolean logic network optimization, using heuristic scripts to refine circuit designs.
The tutorial uses the RUGGED script, a standard optimization method, to simplify Boolean networks.

Input and Output Formats:

SIS can read files in various formats, including the PLA (Programmable Logic Array) format used by the ESPRESSO tool, which defines Boolean functions in a truth table format. This compatibility allows users to edit PLA files and optimize them within SIS.
The optimized output is a Boolean network model, with nodes in the network represented in two-level Sum-of-Products (SOP) form.
Example 1: Optimizing Boolean Functions:

The document demonstrates a simple example with two Boolean functions (s0 and s1), each dependent on four input variables (a1, a0, b1, b0).
After optimization in SIS, primary outputs are shown in braces (e.g., {s0}), and any intermediate nodes generated are shown in brackets (e.g., [2]). This example provides insights into reading the optimized network output.
For complexity analysis, the tutorial explains how to count nodes, literals (variables in each expression), and AND gate product terms in the network.

Example 2: 2-bit Multiplier:

This example demonstrates a more complex Boolean network for a 2-bit multiplier. Inputs are two 2-bit numbers, and the output is a 4-bit product.
Similar to the first example, the SIS output provides an optimized Boolean network, illustrating intermediate nodes and their connections.
The tutorial highlights counting methods for complexity analysis (nodes, literals, AND gate terms) for this multiplier circuit.

Boolean Network Diagrams:
The tutorial shows how to visualize SIS-optimized networks as Boolean diagrams, where each node represents a logical operation, and connections show data flow between nodes.

Purpose of SIS in VLSI Design:
SIS is valuable for optimizing digital circuits by minimizing logic expressions, leading to more efficient VLSI designs. This tutorial provides a hands-on guide to using SIS for Boolean logic network optimization and reading output for analysis, helping users improve their designs for better performance, reduced size, and potentially lower power consumption.
